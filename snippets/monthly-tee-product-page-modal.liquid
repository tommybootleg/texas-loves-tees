    <h3>What is Shirt of the Month?</h3>
<p>Shirt of the Month is a subscription-based program where we design and produce an Texas-themed t-shirt each month! Each shirt has a unique Texas flair to it and costs just $12 each month (+$3.04 for tax and shipping).</p>

<h3>How does Shirt of the Month work?</h3>
<p>When you subscribe to Shirt of the Month, you’ll pay $15.04 and will be shipped our “Doin’ Fine” Introductory shirt (all new subscribers receive this t-shirt). You will then be charged on the 1st of every month and will receive a new, Texas-themed t-shirt within the first week of each new month thereafter. There is no contract involved with Shirt of the Month and you are free to cancel at anytime … but hey, at just $12/month who would want to cancel, right?</p>

<h3>How does billing work for my subscription?</h3>
<p>Upon enrollment your credit or debit card will immediately be charged $15.04 ($12 for the shirt, +$3.04 shipping), and you will be shipped your “Doin’ Fine” Introductory shirt. Then, on the 1st of every month thereafter, you will be charged $15.04 for that month’s uniquely designed, Texas-themed t-shirt, which you will receive within the first week.</p>

<h3>Will all of your Shirt of the Month t-shirts have an Texas-theme?</h3>
<p>Yes! We are a local Texas company, and love this land we call home. The people of Texas, scattered around our country, are unique and pride themselves in this grand land, and through Shirt of the Month, we want to offer them a way to wear their pride.</p>

<h3>Can I purchase the Shirt of the Month without enrolling in the program?</h3>
<p>We offer some sale shirts and some special limited edition items to non-subscribers, but most of our products are for subscribers only. Follow us on Facebook and Instagram to stay in the loop!</p>

<h3>What kind of shirts do use?</h3>
<p>We are transitioning to Bella Canvas!</p>

Eco-friendly and sweatshop free production.</p>

<p>The material of our shirts is either 100% Airlume cotton or a 60/40 polyester/Airlume cotton blend, which depends on the color. Airlume cotton spinning is the Bella Canvas method, which produces the softest tees you'll ever wear!  All of our shirts are preshrunk and unisex. We always send an email preview around mid-month so you’ll see (and get excited for) what is coming your way the next month!</p>
